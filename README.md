Welcome to PyPLIF-HIPPOS's project page. PyPLIF-HIPPOS is an upgraded version of [PyPLIF](https://github.com/radifar/pyplif/) (**Python-based Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting**), a tool for molecular docking post-analysis. It will translate the 3D coordinates of both ligand(s) (generated from docking simulation) and protein into a series of *interaction bitstring* (also known as *Interaction Fingerprint*) (see image below). **HIPPOS** (/ˌhipoʊz/) is a recursive acronym of **HIPPOS Is PyPLIF On Steroids**. From this point forward, PyPLIF-HIPPOS is simplified to HIPPOS.

Compared to PyPLIF, HIPPOS is not only faster and able to generate more customized interaction bitstring, but also supports both [PLANTS](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/pharmazie-und-biochemie/pharmazie/pharmazeutische-chemie/pd-dr-t-exner/research/plants/) & [Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/)! More over, unlike its predecessor it is (far) more well-documented.
